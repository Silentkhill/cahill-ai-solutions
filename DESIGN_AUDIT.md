## CRITICAL ISSUES (P0)

### 1. Visual Noise & Cognitive Load
**Problem:** 
- Excessive animations (mouse parallax, floating blobs, gradient shifts)
- Too many decorative elements competing for attention
- Complex hover states everywhere
- Background blobs and patterns create distraction

**Impact:** 
- Visitors can't focus on core message
- Feels "busy" and overwhelming
- Doesn't match "calm, confident" brand positioning

**Fix:** 
- Remove all decorative animations
- Simplify backgrounds to solid colors or subtle gradients
- Reduce hover effects to essential interactions only
- Increase whitespace dramatically

### 2. Copy Clarity Issues
**Problem:**
- Hero value bullets are repetitive ("Reduce admin work" appears twice)
- "What We Actually Do" section uses technical language
- Missing clear "who this is for" statement upfront
- Trust signals buried in About section

**Impact:**
- Visitors don't immediately understand value prop
- Doesn't address skepticism upfront
- Missing clear positioning statement

**Fix:**
- Rewrite hero bullets to be distinct and outcome-focused
- Simplify service descriptions to plain language
- Add "who this is for" prominently in hero
- Move trust signals earlier

### 3. Section Density
**Problem:**
- Too many sections (10 total)
- Each section tries to do too much
- Missing clear visual hierarchy between sections
- "Use Cases" section feels redundant with "Who This Is For"

**Impact:**
- Site feels long and overwhelming
- Visitors lose focus
- Key information gets buried

**Fix:**
- Consolidate sections (remove Use Cases, merge Trust Signals)
- Reduce content per section
- Increase spacing between sections
- Use clear visual breaks

### 4. Trust & Credibility
**Problem:**
- Trust signals appear late (in About section)
- No clear positioning statement upfront
- Missing reassurance about "no hype" positioning
- About section is too long

**Impact:**
- Visitors don't build trust quickly enough
- Skeptical small business owners bounce before seeing credibility

**Fix:**
- Add trust indicators to hero
- Shorten About section significantly
- Add "no hype" reassurance earlier
- Make positioning statement clearer

### 7. Mobile Experience
